# Meteora Operations

Github Repo for the Meteora Operations team.

This repository will be used to develop an open Blacklist of wallets linked to wash-trading, rug pulls, or any other suspicious activity on Meteora.

These wallets will be excluded from any allocation of MET.

Please feel free to submit a PR and add into the CSV file with address,reason/evidence if you want to add addresses to this blacklist.

### Latest addition: Kelsier Addresses

We've added a list of wallet addresses associated with Kelsier Ventures, thanks to @dethective on Twitter and Arkham Intelligence.
