# Meteora Operations

This repository is maintained by the Meteora Operations team to develop an open blacklist of wallets linked to wash trading, rug pulls, or other suspicious activity on Meteora.

# Purpose

Wallets listed in this repository will be excluded from any allocation of MET.

# How to Contribute

If you believe a wallet should be blacklisted, you can submit a Pull Request (PR) with the following details:

1. Address – The wallet address you want to blacklist.
2. Reason/Evidence – A brief explanation and supporting evidence (e.g., links to on-chain data, X posts, reports or research).

Add the new wallet entry to the blacklist.csv file in the following format:
- wallet_address, reason/evidence

Submit a PR with a short description of why the wallet should be blacklisted.


### Latest addition: Kelsier Addresses
