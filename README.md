## Update: 22 March 2025

- Created an issue template to streamline the submission of wallet addresses.
- This blacklist will focus on wallets associated with **Kelsier Ventures only**. For wallets suspected of DLMM washtrading/rugpulls, please use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSevViXtkyOvU1nHwshhzzk6dNh-jFayxon5N8NuKxtAWpEWlw/viewform) instead.

# Meteora Operations

This repository is maintained by the Meteora Operations team to develop an open blacklist of wallets associated with Kelsier Ventures.

We've partnered with with [Bubblemaps](https://x.com/bubblemaps) and [Rugcheck](https://x.com/Rugcheckxyz) to help independently verify submissions and maintain the integrity of this blacklist.

# Purpose

Wallets listed in this repository will be excluded from any allocation of MET.

# How to Contribute

If you believe a wallet should be blacklisted, you can create a new issue and select the provided template **"Issue Template: Kelsier Ventures"**.

Guidelines: 

1. Associated Wallet Addresses – Provide a list of addresses that you believe to be associated with Kelsier Ventures.
2. Reasoning – Describe how the submitted addresses are associated to Kelsier Ventures.
3. Methodology - Explain the method used to discover the addresses and provide details like transaction hashes, screenshots and relevant links that can help with verification.

The team or our partners will help to verify your submission and may ask for additional information to assist with verification. If there is clear evidence that the submitted wallets are associated with Kelsier, we will merge the new wallets into `kelsier_addresses.csv`.

_The repository and issue template is inspired by a similar initiative by [Safe Global](https://github.com/safe-global) and [Hop Protocol](https://github.com/hop-protocol/hop-airdrop)._
